</div>

<p>I am glad to have the chance to speak
to you to-day. This is the heart of what
may be called the Old West, which we
now call the Middle West, using the term
to denote that great group of rich and
powerful States which literally forms the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span>
heart of the country. It is a region whose
people are distinctively American in all
their thoughts, in all their ways of looking
at life; and in its past and its present
alike it is typical of our country. The
oldest men present can still remember the
pioneer days, the days of the white-tilted
ox wagon, of the emigrant, and of the log
cabin in which that emigrant first lived
when he settled to his task as a pioneer
farmer. They were rough days, days of
hard work, and the people who did that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span>
work seemed themselves uncouth and
forbidding to visitors who could not look
below the surface. It is curious and
amusing to think that even as genuine a
lover of his kind, a man normally so free
from national prejudices as Charles Dickens,
should have selected the region
where we are now standing as the seat
of his forlorn “Eden” in Martin Chuzzlewit.
The country he so bitterly assailed
is now one of the most fertile and productive
portions of one of the most fertile and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
productive agricultural territories in all
the world, and the dwellers in this
territory represent a higher average of
comfort, intelligence, and sturdy capacity
for self-government than the people in any
tract of like extent in any other continent.
The land teems with beauty and fertility,
and but a score of years after Dickens
wrote it was shown to be a nursery and
breeding ground of heroes, of soldiers and
statesmen of the highest rank, while the
rugged worth of the rank and file of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
citizenship rendered possible the deeds of
the mighty men who led in council and in
battle. This was the region that brought
forth mighty Abraham Lincoln, the incarnation
of all that is best in democratic life;
and from the loins of the same people, living
only a little farther south, sprang another
of our greatest Presidents, Andrew Jackson,
“Old Hickory”—a man who made mistakes,
like most strong men, but a man of
iron will and incorruptible integrity, fearless,
upright, devoted to the welfare of his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
countrymen, bone of our bone and flesh of
our flesh, a typical American if ever there
was one.</p>

<p>I commend a careful reading of Martin
Chuzzlewit to the pessimists of to-day,
to the men who, instead of fighting hard
to do away with abuses while at the same
time losing no jot of their buoyant hopefulness
for the country, insist that all our
people, socially and industrially, in their
private lives no less than as politicians,
newspaper men, and business men, are at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
a lower ebb than ever before. If ever
any one of you feels a little downcast
over the peculiarly gloomy view of the
present taken by some well-meaning
pessimist of to-day, you will find it a real
comfort to read Martin Chuzzlewit, to see
what a well-meaning pessimist of the past
thought of our people sixty-five years
ago; and then think of the extraordinary
achievement, the extraordinary gain, morally
no less than materially, of those sixty-five
years. Dickens can be read by us<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
now with profit; Elijah Pogram, Hannibal
Chollop, Jefferson Brick and Scadder
have their representatives to-day, plenty
of them; and the wise thing for us
to do is to recognize that these
are still types of evil in politics,
journalism, business, and private life, and
to war against them with all our hearts.
But it is rank folly to regard these as the
only, or the chief, types in our national
life. It was not of much consequence
whether Dickens made such an error or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
not, but it would be of great consequence
if we ourselves did; for a foolish pessimism
is an even greater foe of healthy national
growth than a foolish optimism. It was not
that Dickens invented characters or scenes
that had no basis in fact; on the contrary,
what he said was true, as far as it went; the
trouble was that out of many such half
truths he made a picture which as a whole
was absurd; for often a half truth is the
most dangerous falsehood. It would be
simply silly to be angry over Martin<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
Chuzzlewit; on the contrary, read it, be
amused by it, profit by it; and don’t be
misled by it. Keep a lively watch
against the present-day Pograms and
Bricks; but above all, distrust the
man who would persuade you to feel
downhearted about the country because
of these same Pograms and Bricks, past or
present. It would be foolish to ignore their
existence, or the existence of anything
else that is bad in our national life; but it
would be even more foolish to ignore the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
vaster forces that tell for righteousness.
Friends, there is every reason why we
should fight whatever is evil in the present.
But there is also every reason why
we should feel a sturdy and confident
hope for the future. There are many
wrongs to right; there are many and powerful
wrong doers against whom to war;
and it would be base to shrink from the
contest, or to fail to wage it with a high,
a resolute will. But I am sure that
we shall win in the contest, because<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
I know that the heart of our people
is sound. Our average men and
women are good men and women—and
this is true in all sections of our country
and among all classes of our countrymen.
There is no other nation on earth with
such vast natural resources, or with such
a high standard of living and of industrial
efficiency among its workers. We have
as a nation an era of unexampled prosperity
ahead of us; we shall enjoy it, and
our children will enjoy it after us. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
trend of well-being in this country is
upward, not downward; and this is the
trend in the things of the soul as well as
in the things of the body.</p>

<p>Government in its application is often
a complicated and delicate work, but the
principles of government are, after all,
fairly simple. In a broad general way we
should apply in the affairs of the national
administration, which deals with the interests
of all our eighty-odd millions of people,
just the same rules that are necessary<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
in getting on with our neighbors in our
several neighborhoods; and the nation as a
whole should show substantially the same
qualities that we would expect an honorable
man to show in dealing with his fellows.
To illustrate this, consider for a moment
two phases of governmental action.</p>

<p>First as to international affairs. Among
your own neighbors, among your friends,
what is the attitude you like to see a
man take toward his fellows, the attitude
you wish each of your sons to take when<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
he goes out into the world? Is it not a
combination of readiness and ability to
hold his own if anyone tries to wrong
him, while at the same time showing
careful regard not only for the rights but
for the feelings of others? Of course it
is! Of course the type of man whom
we respect, whom we are proud of if he
is a kinsman, whom we are glad to have
as a friend and neighbor, is the man
who is no milksop, who is not afraid, who
will not tolerate nor hesitate to resent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
insult or injury, but who himself never
inflicts insult or injury, is kindly, good-natured,
thoughtful of others’ rights—in
short, a good man to do business with
or have live in the next house or have
as a friend. On the other hand, the man
who lacks any of those qualities is sure
to be objectionable. If a man is afraid
to hold his own, if he will submit tamely
to wrongdoing, he is contemptible. If
he is a bully, an oppressor, a man who
wrongs or insults others, he is even worse<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
and should be hunted out of the community.
But, on the whole, the most contemptible
position that can possibly be
assumed by any man is that of blustering,
of bragging, of insulting or wronging
other people, while yet expecting to go
through life unchallenged, and being
always willing to back down and accept
humiliation if readiness to make good is
demanded.</p>

<p>Well, all this is just as true of a nation
as of an individual, and in dealing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
with other nations we should act as we
expect a man who is both game and
decent to act in private life. There are
few things cheaper and more objectionable,
whether on the part of the public
man or of the private man, on the part of
a writer or of a speaker, an individual or
a group of individuals, than a course of
conduct which is insulting or hurtful,
whether in speech or act, to individuals
of another nation or to the representatives
of another nation or to another nation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
itself. But the policy becomes infamous
from the standpoint of the interests
of the United States when it is combined
with the refusal to take those
measures of preparation which can alone
secure us from aggression on the part of
others. The policy of “peace with insult”
is the very worst policy upon which it is
possible to embark, whether for a nation
or an individual. To be rich, unarmed,
and yet insolent and aggressive, is to
court well-nigh certain disaster. The only<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
safe and honorable rule of foreign policy
for the United States is to show itself
courteous toward other nations, scrupulous
not to infringe upon their rights, and yet
able and ready to defend its own. This
nation is now on terms of the most cordial
good will with all other nations. Let us
make it a prime object of our policy to
preserve these conditions. To do so it is
necessary on the one hand to mete out a
generous justice to all other peoples and
show them courtesy and respect; and on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
the other hand, as we are yet a good way
off from the millenium, to keep ourselves
in such shape as to make it evident to all
men that we desire peace because we
think it is just and right and not from
motives of weakness or timidity. As for
the first requisite, this means that not only
the Government but the people as a
whole shall act in the needed spirit; for
otherwise the folly of a few individuals
may work lasting discredit to the whole
nation. The second requisite is more<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
easily secured—let us build up and maintain
at the highest point of efficiency the
United States Navy. In any great war
on land we should have to rely in the
future as we have relied in the past chiefly
upon volunteer soldiers; and although it
is indispensable that our little army, an
army ludicrously small relatively to the
wealth and population of this mighty
nation, should itself be trained to the
highest point and should be valued and respected
as is demanded by the worth of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
officers and enlisted men, yet it is not necessary
that this army should be large as
compared to the armies of other great nations.
But as regards the Navy all this is
different. We have an enormous coast line,
and our coast line is on two great oceans.
To repel hostile attacks the fortifications,
and not the Navy, must be used; but the
best way to parry is to hit—no fight can
ever be won except by hitting—and we
can only hit by means of the Navy. It is
utterly impossible to improvise even a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
makeshift navy under the conditions of
modern warfare. Since the days of Napoleon
no war between two great powers has
lasted as long as it would take to build a
battle ship, let alone a fleet of battle ships;
and it takes just as long to train the
crew of a battle ship as it does to build
it; and as regards the most important
thing of all, the training of the officers, it
takes much longer. The Navy must be
built and all its training given in time of
peace. When once war has broken out it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
is too late to do anything. We now have
a good Navy, not yet large enough for our
needs, but of excellent material. Where
a navy is as small as ours, the cardinal
rule must be that the battle ships shall not
be separated. This year I am happy to
say that we shall begin a course which I
hope will be steadily followed hereafter,
that, namely, of keeping the battle-ship
fleet alternately in the Pacific and in the
Atlantic. Early in December the fleet will
begin its voyage to the Pacific, and it will<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
number, friends, among its formidable
fighting craft three great battle ships,
named, respectively, the <i>Illinois</i>, the <i>Missouri</i>,
and the <i>Kentucky</i>. It is a national
fleet in every sense of the term, and its
welfare should be, and I firmly believe is,
as much a matter of pride and concern for
every man in the farthest interior of our
country as for every man on the seacoast.
A long ocean voyage is mighty good training;
and not the least good it will do will
be to show just the points where our naval<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
program needs strengthening. Incidentally
I think the voyage will have one
good effect, for, to judge by their comments
on the movement, some excellent people
in my own section of the country need to
be reminded that the Pacific coast is exactly
as much a part of this nation as the
Atlantic coast.</p>

<p>So much for foreign affairs. Now for
a matter of domestic policy. Here in this
country we have founded a great federal
democratic republic. It is a government<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
by and for the people and therefore a
genuine democracy; and the theory of our
Constitution is that each neighborhood
shall be left to deal with the things that
concern only itself and which it can most
readily deal with; so that town, county, city,
and State have their respective spheres
of duty, while the nation deals with those
matters which concern all of us, all of the
people, no matter where we dwell. Our
democracy is based upon the belief that
each individual ought to have the largest<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
measure of liberty compatible with securing
the rights of other individuals, that
the average citizen, the plain man whom
we meet in daily life, is normally capable
of taking care of his own affairs, and has
no desire to wrong any one else; and yet
that in the interest of all there shall be
sufficient power lodged somewhere to prevent
wicked people from trampling the
weak under foot for their own gain. Our
constant endeavor is to make a good
working compromise whereby we shall<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
secure the full benefit of individual initiative
and responsibility, while at the same
time recognizing that it is the function of
a wise government under modern conditions
not merely to protect life and property,
but to foster the social development
of the people so far as this may be done
by maintaining and promoting justice,
honesty, and equal rights. We believe in
a real, not a sham, democracy. We believe
in democracy as regards political
rights, as regards education, and, finally,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
as regards industrial conditions. By
democracy we understand securing, as
far as it is humanly possible to secure it,
equality of opportunity, equality of the
conditions under which each man is to
show the stuff that is in him and to
achieve the measure of success to which
his own force of mind and character
entitle him. Religiously this means that
each man is to have the right, unhindered
by the state, to worship his Creator as his
conscience dictates, granting freely to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
others the same freedom which he asks for
himself. Politically we can be said substantially
to have worked out our democratic
ideals, and the same is true,
thanks to the common schools, in educational
matters. But in industry there
has not as yet been the governmental
growth necessary in order to meet the tremendous
changes brought about in industrial
conditions by steam and electricity.
It is not in accordance with our principles
that literally despotic power should be put<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
into the hands of a few men in the affairs
of the industrial world. Our effort must
be for a just and effective plan of action
which, while scrupulously safeguarding the
rights of the men of wealth, shall yet, so
far as is humanly possible, secure under
the law to all men equality of opportunity
to make a living. It is to the interest of
all of us that the man of exceptional business
capacity should be amply rewarded;
and there is nothing inconsistent with this
in our insistence that he shall not be guilty<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
of bribery or extortion, and that the rights of
the wageworker and of the man of small
means, who are themselves honest and
hard working, shall be scrupulously safeguarded.
The instruments for the exercise
of modern industrial power are the
great corporations which, though created
by the individual States, have grown far
beyond the control of those States and
transact their business throughout large
sections of the Union. These corporations,
like the industrial conditions which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
have called them into being, did not exist
when the Constitution was founded; but
the wise forethought of the founders provided,
under the interstate commerce clause
of the Constitution, for the very emergency
which has arisen, if only our people as a
whole will realize what this emergency is;
for if the people thoroughly realize it, their
governmental representatives will soon
realize it also. The National Government
alone has sufficiently extensive power
and jurisdiction to exercise adequate control<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
over the great interstate corporations.
While this thorough supervision and control
by the National Government is desirable
primarily in the interest of the people,
it will also, I firmly believe, be to the
benefit of those corporations themselves
which desire to be honest and law-abiding.
Only thus can we put over these corporations
one competent and efficient sovereign—the
Nation—able both to exact
justice from them and to secure justice for
them, so that they may not be alternately<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
pampered and oppressed. The proposal
need be dreaded only by those corporations
which do not wish to obey the
law or to be controlled in just fashion, but
prefer to take their chances under the
present lack of all system and to court the
chance of getting improper favors as offsetting
the chance of being blackmailed—an
attitude rendered familiar in the past
by those corporations which had thriven
under certain corrupt and lawless city
governments.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span></p>

<p>The first need is to exercise this Federal
control in thoroughgoing and efficient
fashion over the railroads, which, because
of their peculiar position, offer the most
immediate and urgent problem. The
American people abhor a vacuum, and
is determined that this control shall be
exercised somewhere; it is most unwise
for the railroads not to recognize this and to
submit to it as the first requisite of the situation.
When this control is exercised in
some such fashion as it is now exercised<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
over the national banks, there will be no
falling off in business prosperity. On the
contrary, the chances for the average man to
do better will be increased. Undoubtedly
there will be much less opportunity than
at present for a very few individuals not
of the most scrupulous type to amass
great fortunes by speculating in and manipulating
securities which are issued without
any kind of control or supervision.
But there will be plenty of room left for
ample legitimate reward for business genius,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
while the chance for the man who is
not a business genius, but who is a good,
thrifty, hard-working citizen, will be better.
I do not believe that our efforts will
have anything but a beneficial effect upon
the permanent prosperity of the country;
and, as a matter of fact, even as regards
any temporary effect, I think that any
trouble is due fundamentally not to the
fact that the national authorities have discovered
and corrected certain abuses, but
to the fact that those abuses were there<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
to be discovered. I think that the excellent
people who have complained of
our policy as hurting business have shown
much the same spirit as the child who
regards the dentist and not the ulcerated
tooth as the real source of his woe. I
am as certain as I can be of anything that the
course we are pursuing will ultimately help
business; for the corrupt man of business is
as great a foe to this country as the corrupt
politician. Both stand on the same evil
eminence of infamy. Against both it is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
necessary to war; and if, unfortunately, in
either type of warfare, a few innocent people
are hurt, the responsibility lies not with
us, but with those who have misled them
to their hurt.</p>

<p>This is a rapidly growing nation,
on a new continent, and in an era of
new, complex, and ever-shifting conditions.
Often it is necessary to devise new
methods of meeting these new conditions.
We must regard the past, but we must
not regard only the past. We must also<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
think of the future; and while we must
learn by experience, we can not afford to
pay heed merely to the teachings of experience.
The great preacher Channing in
his essay on “The Union” spoke with fine
insight on this very point. In commenting
on the New England statesman Cabot,
whom he greatly admired, he said that
nevertheless “he had too much of the wisdom
of experience; he wanted what may
be called the wisdom of hope.” He then
continued in words which have a peculiar<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
fitness for the conditions of to-day: “We
apprehend that it is possible to make experience
too much our guide. There are
seasons in human affairs, of inward and
outward revolution, when new depths seem
to be broken up in the soul, when new
wants are unfolded in multitudes, and a
new and undefined good is thirsted for.
These are periods when the principles of
experience need to be modified, when hope
and trust and instinct claim a share
with prudence in the guidance of affairs,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
when in truth <em>to dare</em> is the highest
wisdom.”</p>

<p>These sentences should be carefully
pondered by those men, often very good
men, who forget that constructive change
offers the best method of avoiding destructive
change; that reform is the antidote to
revolution; and that social reform is not
the precursor but the preventive of
socialism.</p>

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply

other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right

Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
